# 📝 Monkeytype Clone

This project is a simple typing speed test inspired by Monkeytype 🐒⌨️. It allows users to test their typing speed by displaying random words and calculating metrics like Words Per Minute (WPM), Characters Per Minute (CPM), accuracy, and errors.

### ✨ Features

🎯 Displays random words for typing

⚡ Tracks Words Per Minute (WPM) and Characters Per Minute (CPM)

✅ Calculates typing accuracy and errors

⏳ Includes a countdown timer (60 seconds by default)

### 🛠 Technologies Used

🌐 HTML

🎨 CSS

⚙️ JavaScript

### 🚀 How to Use

Open [this link](https://nathutev.github.io/monkeytype). 🌍

Click inside the typing area to start the test. 🏁

Type the displayed words as accurately and quickly as possible. ⌨️

View your WPM, CPM, accuracy, and errors in real time. 📊

Once the timer reaches 0, the test ends. ⏲

Click the restart button to try again. 🔄

### ⚡ How It Works

The project fetches random words using a word module. 📖

It tracks the user's input, compares it with the displayed text, and updates the accuracy and error count dynamically. 🔍

The timer starts as soon as the user begins clicks on input area. ⏳

Once time runs out, input is disabled, and the restart button appears. 🛑

### 🔮 Future Improvements

⏱ Add different time settings (30s, 60s, 120s)

🌍 Add multiple languages
